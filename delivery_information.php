     		<p>www.MoreGreatStuff.ca uses major courier companies such as UPS, Fed Ex and Purolator 
     			to ship products to you. We rate compare these couriers based on the individual shipments 
     			to provide the most cost effective shipping method possible. Should you require a specific 
     			courier, then rates are not negotiated on your behalf with that company.
     		</p>
     		
			<p>The purchaser is required to pay all shipping and handling costs unless specific information regarding 
				free shipping is identified on this site in conjunction with the associated product information. 
			</p>
			
			<p>All shipments are made F.O.B. our warehouse. (F.O.B. stands for freight on board and indicates the location 
				where transfer of ownership is made. In this case, ownership is transferred once the shipment has left our 
				warehouse). If the shipment is lost or damaged, the purchaser is to place the claim with the courier company. 
			</p>
			
			<p>The courier companies cannot ship to a post office box. Should you need this kind of shipping destination, 
				then Canada Post will be the method of shipment and extra handling charges may apply.
			</p>
			
			<p>Customers must give valid and accurate shipping addresses and are to be available to receive shipments. Shipments 
				that are returned to us by the shipping companies due to address inaccuracies or lack of available person to 
				receive goods will result in additional charges to re-ship products. 
			</p>
			
			<p>We do not provide for customer pick up services. For any information about our delivery services, please contact 
				us via email at <a href="info@MoreGreatStuff.ca">info@MoreGreatStuff.ca</a>.</p>
