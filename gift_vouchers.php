     		<p>Gift Vouchers are issued only for specific dollar amounts and not for products. If the voucher was given for a specific product, then it is the responsibility of the holder of the gift voucher to redeem the voucher for the product in a reasonable time period. We are not responsible for providing products that have been discontinued.</p> 
			<p>Gift Vouchers are not redeemable for cash. Gift vouchers must be used within one year of purchase date. Gift Vouchers reduce in value by 50% of the original value on the annual anniversary date of issuance.</p>
			<p>Gift Vouchers can only be used for purchases on www.MoreGreatStuff.ca.</p>
			<p>Coupons are only redeemable for products or services identified specifically by the coupon under the terms and conditions of the coupon. Coupons have an expiration date.</p> 
			<p>To request a Gift Voucher or request info on what coupons are currently available, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@MoreGreatStuff.ca">info@MoreGreatStuff.ca</a>. We thank you for your business.</p>
